Below is a more **complete** rewrite of your query using **Approach A** (direct interval overlap filtering + final date expansion) so that you can still return the per-day column (`dd.date`). Then, we will discuss whether **Snowflake Dynamic Tables** are suitable for your scenario and what alternatives might exist.

---

## 1. Overview of Approach A (with per-day output)

1. **Filter each table** to keep only rows whose `[fromdate, todate)` intervals overlap the user’s query range \([$start\_date, $end\_date$]\).  
2. **Join** these filtered tables on `sec_id` and further check interval overlap among themselves (if needed).  
3. **Finally**, to get an actual “per-day” row (i.e., a `dd.date` column in the output), join to `dim_date` **restricted** to the intersection of (1) the user’s date range and (2) the overlapping intervals from your joined tables.

This avoids scanning all rows in `dim_date` as the “driver,” while still ultimately expanding to a row-per-day for only the relevant portion of data.

## 2. Example Rewrite Query

Below is a **conceptual** example; adapt table/column names and filters as needed.

```sql
-- 1. Convert session variables into timestamps once at the top:
WITH params AS (
  SELECT
    to_timestamp_ntz($start_date) AS start_dt,
    to_timestamp_ntz($end_date)   AS end_dt
),

-- 2. Filter each table by user’s date range
--    This discards rows that definitely cannot overlap with [start_dt, end_dt].
t1_filtered AS (
  SELECT t1.*
  FROM dim_t1 t1
  JOIN params p 
    ON t1.t1_fromdate < p.end_dt
   AND t1.t1_todate   > p.start_dt
  WHERE t1.ob_inc = 0
    AND t1.sec_id IS NOT NULL
),
t2_filtered AS (
  SELECT t2.*
  FROM dim_t2 t2
  JOIN params p
    ON t2.t2_fromdate < p.end_dt
   AND t2.t2_todate   > p.start_dt
  WHERE t2.ob_inc = 0
),
t3_filtered AS (
  SELECT t3.*
  FROM dim_t3 t3
  JOIN params p
    ON t3.t3_fromdate < p.end_dt
   AND t3.t3_todate   > p.start_dt
  WHERE t3.ob_inc = 0
),
t4_filtered AS (
  SELECT t4.*
  FROM ref_t4 t4
  JOIN params p
    ON t4.t4_fromdate < p.end_dt
   AND t4.t4_todate   > p.start_dt
  WHERE t4.ob_inc = 0
),
t5_filtered AS (
  SELECT t5.*
  FROM ref_t5 t5
  JOIN params p
    ON t5.t5_fromdate < p.end_dt
   AND t5.t5_todate   > p.start_dt
  WHERE t5.ob_inc = 0
),

-- 3. Now join these filtered sets together on sec_id (and check intervals overlap if needed)
joined_data AS (
  SELECT
    t1.sec_id,
    t1.t1_fromdate,
    t1.t1_todate,
    t2.t2_fromdate,
    t2.t2_todate,
    t2.product_name,
    t3.t3_fromdate,
    t3.t3_todate,
    t3.trans_number,
    t4.t4_fromdate,
    t4.t4_todate,
    t4.address,
    t5.t5_fromdate,
    t5.t5_todate,
    t5.extra_info
  FROM t1_filtered t1
  INNER JOIN t2_filtered t2
    ON t2.sec_id = t1.sec_id
       -- If you need to ensure t1's intervals and t2's intervals actually overlap:
       AND t2.t2_fromdate < t1.t1_todate
       AND t2.t2_todate   > t1.t1_fromdate
  INNER JOIN t3_filtered t3
    ON t3.sec_id = t1.sec_id
       AND t3.t3_fromdate < t1.t1_todate
       AND t3.t3_todate   > t1.t1_fromdate
  LEFT JOIN t4_filtered t4
    ON t4.sec_id = t1.sec_id
       AND t4.t4_fromdate < t1.t1_todate
       AND t4.t4_todate   > t1.t1_fromdate
  LEFT JOIN t5_filtered t5
    ON t5.sec_id = t1.sec_id
       AND t5.t5_fromdate < t1.t1_todate
       AND t5.t5_todate   > t1.t1_fromdate
),

-- 4. Compute min/max overlap for each sec_id combination
--    We’ll need these to find the range of actual valid days for each joined row.
--    The actual day-by-day expansion must be from the MAX of all fromdates
--    to the MIN of all todates, intersected with the user’s [start_dt, end_dt].
valid_ranges AS (
  SELECT
    sec_id,
    product_name,
    trans_number,
    address,
    extra_info,
    GREATEST(t1_fromdate, t2_fromdate, t3_fromdate, 
             COALESCE(t4_fromdate, '1900-01-01'::timestamp_ntz),
             COALESCE(t5_fromdate, '1900-01-01'::timestamp_ntz)) AS row_fromdate,
    LEAST(t1_todate, t2_todate, t3_todate,
          COALESCE(t4_todate, '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz),
          COALESCE(t5_todate, '9999-12-31'::timestamp_ntz)) AS row_todate
  FROM joined_data
)

-- Final SELECT with expansion to dd.date
SELECT
  dd.date_tm AS date,
  v.sec_id,
  v.product_name,
  v.trans_number,
  v.address,
  v.extra_info
FROM valid_ranges v

-- 5. JOIN dim_date on the final valid interval for each row
JOIN dim_date dd
  ON dd.date_tm >= v.row_fromdate
   AND dd.date_tm <  v.row_todate

  -- Also ensure we only take days within [start_dt, end_dt] (i.e. user’s query range).
  JOIN params p
    ON dd.date_tm >= p.start_dt
   AND dd.date_tm <= p.end_dt

ORDER BY
  v.sec_id,
  dd.date_tm
;
```

### Key Points in This Rewrite

1. **Early Filtering**: Each table is first filtered to rows that can possibly intersect the user’s input date range.  
2. **Interval Overlap Joins**: You join these subsets on `sec_id` and optionally check that each pair truly overlaps.  
3. **Compute the Combined Overlap**: For each resulting row, you find the final `[row_fromdate, row_todate)` range.  
4. **Join to `dim_date`**: You now only expand days within that final combined range, intersected with \($start_date, $end_date\). That is much smaller than your original approach of starting with `dim_date` as the driver for every day in the entire range.

## 3. If the Above Query is Still Slow…

1. **Clustering**:  
   - Try clustering each large table (e.g., `dim_t1`, `dim_t2`) on their `[fromdate, todate]` columns or on `(sec_id, fromdate)` if that helps micro-partition pruning.  
   - For `dim_date`, you might already have it well-partitioned, but typically it’s not huge anyway.  

2. **Bridge Table Approach**:  
   - If you frequently need day-by-day expansions and your intervals aren’t *massive*, consider building a “bridge” table. E.g., `dim_t1_bridge(sec_id, date_tm)`. Then queries become fast equality joins on `(sec_id, date_tm)`.  
   - This can be very fast for queries, *but* will take extra storage to pre-flatten intervals.

3. **Consider Incremental Materialized Data**:  
   - If you repeatedly query the *same* or *similar* date ranges, you can store partial results. For example, create a permanent or transient table that holds pre-calculated day expansions for each table.  
   - This is effectively a manual materialization strategy.

## 4. About **Snowflake Dynamic Tables**

**Dynamic Tables** (preview feature) let you define a table that automatically refreshes its contents based on a SQL query. They are somewhat analogous to “incrementally refreshing” materialized views. However, two critical limitations often arise:

1. **Session Variables**: Dynamic table definitions are static. They do *not* dynamically change based on each user’s `$start_date` or `$end_date`. They’re designed to be updated continuously in the background, not re-parameterized on each query.  
2. **Per-User or Per-Query Filters**: If you need custom filters each time a user runs a query, you can’t pass those into a dynamic table at runtime.

Therefore, if your scenario truly requires **each query** to use different `$start_date, $end_date, and maybe other session filters**, dynamic tables **will not** solve that. They are best when you have a relatively fixed transformation or a known incremental logic that doesn’t rely on session-level parameters.

### Alternative if You Need Materialization with Parameters

- **On-Demand / Precompute**: You could create a stored procedure or a task that, given `$start_date` and `$end_date`, builds or refreshes a parameterized table (or ephemeral table) with your day-by-day expansions. But that’s not an official “dynamic table” because dynamic tables do not support per-session parameters.

---

## 5. Final Recommendations

1. **Use Approach A** (as illustrated) with early filtering and only expand to days at the very end. This usually yields a big performance improvement.  
2. If queries remain slow and you consistently need daily expansions, **bridge tables** may be the next step— but balance the storage overhead.  
3. **Clustering** on `[fromdate, todate]` or `(fromdate, sec_id)` can further reduce scanning overhead.  
4. **Dynamic Tables** aren’t well-suited if each query uses different session variables. They are more for continuous, parameterless transformations.  
5. If you have repeated queries with similar date ranges, consider a **semi-manual materialization** approach (e.g., building ephemeral tables or bridging tables in a stored procedure).

Following these guidelines will help you **significantly improve** the performance of your date-range join queries in Snowflake while still returning day-by-day rows (`dd.date`) in the output.
